# Welcome to the global-samples repository for IBM Connections Customizer

## What's Here?
### 1. Simple Samples
Each folder in this repository contains a separate sample designed to demonstrate some of Customizer capabilities.  You can try them out in your organization by copy/pasting one or more of the sample JSON files into the Application Registry in your tenant org (requires Administrator access). For experimental purposes, you can restrict the user audience by using some of the matching criteria explained [here in the online documentation][1], e.g. if you just want to see the samples yourself and not expose them to all users.
