# About Nifty Scripties

Nifty Scripties combines 10 commonly used Customizer samples into a single app for demo and educational purposes. The application is available in the IBM Connections Catalog for cloud tenants. Essentially the catalog installs an equivalent of the [niftyScriptiesApp.json][1] file into the App Registry for tenant organizations and automatically applies a user filter to run the application just for the organziation adminstrator. This is to facilitate experimentaion with Customizer and make it easier to get up to speed with this offering.

On-Premises customers can copy/paste the JSON file in this folder to their local App Registry to achieve the same result. The contents of each `include-repo` referenced in the JSON file needs to be deployed to the local `pv-connections/customizations` directory on the Storage node.

Watch this space - more information coming shortly...
